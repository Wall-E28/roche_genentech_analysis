# Roche's Acquisition of Genentech Analysis

## Overview 

This project assesses the acquisition of Genentech by Roche in 2009. This was a project completed through my Mergers &amp; Acquisitions course as Santa Clara University using Harvard Business Review Materials. The analysis is broken down into two areas: written and financial analysis. THe written analysis answer key business and strategy questions about the acquisition, while the financial analysis breaks down the effectiveness of the acquistion monetarily.
